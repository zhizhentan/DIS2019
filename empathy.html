										<b>Background:</b><br>

										Humans have sensitive hands, but other parts of the skin are not so sensitive, which are even covered by clothes most of the time with no chance to feel the world. <br><br>
										<b>Design statement:</b><br>

									Inspired by the “nose” of the star-nosed mole, the touch enhancement device can be attached to different parts of the body and enhance the local sensitivity of touch. The experimental sensory challenge encourages people to touch the world without hand. It is not so likely for most people to understand what it is like to be a star-nosed mole and how it would be like to perceive the world mainly with touch. But at least they can try and imagine what it would be probably like.</u></a>.

									<span><p><b>Special touch sensory organ and corresponding brain organization:</b><br>
									The star-nosed mole’s “nose” is not an olfactory organ, but a skin surface that mediates touch. Innervated by more than 100,000 sensory neurons, the star is probably the most sensitive and highly acute touch organ found on any mammal. Its nose is ringed by 22 fleshy appendages, called rays, which are engorged with blood and in a constant flurry of motion when the animal searches for food. The star-nosed mole has special brain organization to process the high-resolution touch signal. [2]</p></span>

									<span><p><b> "What is it like to be a star-nosed mole?":</b><br>
									 "What is it like to be a bat?" is a famous question put forward by Nagel[3]. Nagel's own answer to his question is that we will never know. Indeed, it is impossible for humans to know exactly how animals perceive the world because of the differnet physical structures, different capabilities of sensory organs, and even the brain organizations. However, what we can do could be provide an emulation of part of the animals' perception process, which could probably evoke people's imagination and empathy. In this case, I introduce a touch enhancement device and a experimental sensory challenge to encourage people to touch the world with different parts of their bodies rather than hands. People are invited to imagine and interpret their lives where touch is their main source of sensation.   </p></span>
