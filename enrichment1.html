									<span><p><b>What is environment enrichment?</b><br><br>
										According to Newberry in Environmental enrichment: Increasing the biological relevance of captive environments [1], the general goal and criteria of environment enrichment should be improving the animal’s health, promoting the animal’s reproductive success, and promoting the animals’ inclusive fitness. What should be paid attention on is that there are two distinct kinds of environment enrichment with different ultimate goal. For the animal destined for release, the goal of modifying environment is to make the captivity resemble the future release site for the sake of future reintroduction. In this case, the animals’ natural behaviors should be elicited and cultivated. On the other hand, for the animals that are kept indefinitely in captivity for use by people, it is neither necessary nor desirable for them to remain adapted to the natural environment. In this case, the key rests in helping them adapt to the captive conditions. 

										As for how to measure the effect of the environment and the welfare of animals, Newberry thought that compared with measuring the abnormal behaviors and negative emotion of animals, it is more reliable and feasible to measure the physical health status, including the harmful aggression tendency, trend of escaping, and the status of muscular and skeletal fitness. 

										Ways can be used in enriching environment,  including increasing food variety to stimulate animals’ food searching and handling skills, triggering the natural and inherent way of food intaking, providing suitable substrate, providing optimal physical spatial structure, providing camouflage and shelter for animals to gain sense of safety, providing views of natural sceneries,  making tourists less visible, and providing sound enrichment.

									<span><p><b>Introduction of the sea otter</b><br><br>
										The sea otter is one of the smartest species in the world. It has the densest fur among animals, and it is the reason why sea otters are widely hunted by people to make high quality leather garments. The Sea Otter was almost completely extinct by 1911 with less than 2,000 of them remaining. However, successful conservation efforts managed to recover the population of the sea otter.  In most areas it is illegal to harm or to kill them due to the fact that they remain listed as an Endangered Species. The sea otter mainly reside in the Northern Pacific Ocean coast area, especially the coast area of California[2]

										Experts believe that it can move on land but that it chooses not to. It does very well living exclusively in the water [3]. The sea otter is a “newcomer” mammal of ocean life, compared with other marine mammals like the sea lions and the whales, which just waded into the ocean a mere couple million years ago [4].

									<span><p>Picture courtesy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxqg_um1TXI" style="color: gray"><u>Deep Look</u></a><br>
									One of the consequence of this is that the sea otter do not have blubber, so they have to spend a lot of time in a day grooming to recover the waterproof and heat trapping capability of the fur after diving [5]. </p></span>

									<span><p><b>Design background, motivation, object and goal:</b><br>
										Inspired by the Saving Sea Otter 696, a case of the sea otter surrogate program, which is a part of the sea otter rescuing programme of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, I am interested in designing enrichment device for raising and training sea otter in such kind of program. I believe that the sea otter 696 would not be the only stranded sea otter pup that needs help from humans to survive and return to nature eventually. Devices and processes should be designed to make humanitarian assistance more effortless.<br><br>

										In this case, I focus on designing surrogate devices that help the sea otter orphans learn and improve their skills of swimming and doing basic rolling and turning over actions in the water. Hopefully, basic social skills can be triggered. The surrogate devices substitute the roles that should originally be played by the moms and peers in the natural states.

											<b>Proposal 1:<br><br>																									
											Inspiration:</b> <br>

										— Swimming is not an inherent behavior of the sea otter. In the wild, mom would tow the pup between feeding and resting area [7]. From the video below(0:28 - 0:31), it can be discovered that the sea otter pup was trying to turn over clumsily but failed. I conjecture that the action of turning over and also rolling in the water are not inherent, which should be taught and are ubiquitous in a lot of behaviors listed in the ethogram above. </p></span>

												<b>Proposal 2:<br><br>																									
												Inspiration:</b> <br>
												— From observation of the precedent works of sea otter enrichment, it can easily find out that the sea otters were extremely active and interested in novel things. These toys are in fruitful colors and some of them have food contained or attractive scent diffused.  They tended to touch, grasp, and hold the toys with their held in the forelimbs. If the toys are in motion, they tended to chase after them.<br><br>
											— From the video below(2:18 - 2:26), it can be discoverd that the sea otter pup, with primary ability of swimming, seemed to be aimless and bored while swimming. Later (2:33 - 2:37), it noticed a "target", a purple artificial kelp, and it seemed much more motivated. </p></span>
