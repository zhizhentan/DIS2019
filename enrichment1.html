							<p><b>Enrichment Proposal ——<br>Enhancement for the sea otter orphans:</b><br><br></p>
							<!-- <div class="text">

<!-- 
									<p>

										<b>Background:</b><br>

										Humans have sensitive hands, but other parts of the skin are not so sensitive, which are even covered by clothes most of the time with no chance to feel the world. <br><br>
										<b>Design statement:</b><br>

									Inspired by the “nose” of the star-nosed mole, the touch enhancement device can be attached to different parts of the body and enhance the local sensitivity of touch. The experimental sensory challenge encourages people to touch the world without hand. It is not so likely for most people to understand what it is like to be a star-nosed mole and how it would be like to perceive the world mainly with touch. But at least they can try and imagine what it would be probably like.</u></a>.

									<span><p><b>What is environment enrichment?</b><br><br>
										According to Newberry in Environmental enrichment: Increasing the biological relevance of captive environments [1], the general goal and criteria of environment enrichment should be improving the animal’s health, promoting the animal’s reproductive success, and promoting the animals’ inclusive fitness. What should be paid attention on is that there are two distinct kinds of environment enrichment with different ultimate goal. For the animal destined for release, the goal of modifying environment is to make the captivity resemble the future release site for the sake of future reintroduction. In this case, the animals’ natural behaviors should be elicited and cultivated. On the other hand, for the animals that are kept indefinitely in captivity for use by people, it is neither necessary nor desirable for them to remain adapted to the natural environment. In this case, the key rests in helping them adapt to the captive conditions. 

										As for how to measure the effect of the environment and the welfare of animals, Newberry thought that compared with measuring the abnormal behaviors and negative emotion of animals, it is more reliable and feasible to measure the physical health status, including the harmful aggression tendency, trend of escaping, and the status of muscular and skeletal fitness. 

										Ways can be used in enriching environment,  including increasing food variety to stimulate animals’ food searching and handling skills, triggering the natural and inherent way of food intaking, providing suitable substrate, providing optimal physical spatial structure, providing camouflage and shelter for animals to gain sense of safety, providing views of natural sceneries,  making tourists less visible, and providing sound enrichment.

									<span><p><b>Introduction of the sea otter</b><br><br>
										The sea otter is one of the smartest species in the world. It has the densest fur among animals, and it is the reason why sea otters are widely hunted by people to make high quality leather garments. The Sea Otter was almost completely extinct by 1911 with less than 2,000 of them remaining. However, successful conservation efforts managed to recover the population of the sea otter.  In most areas it is illegal to harm or to kill them due to the fact that they remain listed as an Endangered Species. The sea otter mainly reside in the Northern Pacific Ocean coast area, especially the coast area of California[2]

										Experts believe that it can move on land but that it chooses not to. It does very well living exclusively in the water [3]. The sea otter is a “newcomer” mammal of ocean life, compared with other marine mammals like the sea lions and the whales, which just waded into the ocean a mere couple million years ago [4].

									One of the consequence of this is that the sea otter do not have blubber, so they have to spend a lot of time in a day grooming to recover the waterproof and heat trapping capability of the fur after diving [5]. </p></span>

										<table>
											<tr>
												<th><b>Behaviour</b></th>
												<th><b>Description</b></th>
											</tr>

											<tr>
												<td> Resting on water </td>
												<td>Floating on back either singularly or as a group. Otters head will remain dry whilst the majority of the body is submerged. Otter’s eyes will be open and they can be looking around their environment. </td>
											</tr>

											<tr><td>Resting on land 
											</td>
											<td>Otter lying down either on stomach or back. Eyes are open and otter is looking around at its surroundings, could be either alone or with other individuals. If on stomach then all four limbs will be tucked under the body. </td></tr>

											<tr><td>Feeding</td>
												<td>Resting on back in water or on land with food item on their stomach. Can involve using stones to smash against the outside of food items to crack shells but not necessity. Item is moved from stomach to mouth via forelimbs and placed between teeth which are utilised to masticate item before swallowing </td></embed></tr>

												<tr><td>Foraging</td>
													<td>Otter has moved from the water’s surface moving down head first and utilises whiskers, nose and forelimbs to touch obstacles. This can include pulling items off of the floor or  sides, or can be grabbing objects floating free in the water. These items are then held in the forelimbs as the animal moves back to water surface. It no items are brought back up consider the previous movements to be diving (see below) not foraging.</td></tr>

													<tr><td>Play</td>
														<td>Two or more sea otters in close proximity (less than one body length away from each other) or touching. These interactions can occur both on land and on water. Includes rolling over each other. Running at each other as well a play fighting and pushing </td></tr>

														<tr><td>Grooming-self</td>
															<td>Using mouth, tongue or forepaws to rub at sections of own fur. In water this is achieved whilst floating on back. Can include intermittent bouts of rolling over in the water. </td></tr>

															<tr><td>Allogrooming</td>
																<td>Using mouth, tongue or forepaws to rub at sections of a conspecifics fur. In water this can be achieved whilst floating on backs with one individual placing their head and upper torso on the stomach of another. Most often seen between juveniles and adults but can be individuals of any age. </td></tr>

																<tr><td>Swim</td>
																	<td>Movement through water, can either be on the surface of the water or underneath the surface. Otter is not on its back for any time whilst swimming and utilises hind limbs and tail primarily so little movement from forelimbs which hang down from the body.  </td></tr>

																	<tr><td>Locomotion</td>
																		<td>Movement on terrestrial environment. Movement of all four limbs. May be interspersed with occasional moments of standing still up on hind legs to observe surroundings. If this stop and observe motion is less than 5 seconds long include it as part of locomotion. If longer than this then it is alert behaviour. </td></tr>

																		<tr><td>Sleep</td>
																			<td>Either on back floating on the water or on back or stomach on land. If on water individuals will often anchor by wrapping themselves in kelp or holding on to other individuals usually by linking forepaws. Difference between resting and sleeping is that eyes are shut and individual gives no indication that it is aware of its surroundings. Head will be rested on chest </td></tr>

																			<tr><td>Dive</td>
																				<td>Movement from terrestrial environment to water. Individual slides head first into the water. Is the link between terrestrial locomotion and swimming </td></tr>

																				<tr><td>Vocalisation</td>
																					<td>Any noises made by the otters could be towards conspecifics or humans. Noises can be for any length of time and are accompanied by opening of the mouth </td></tr>

																					<tr><td>Sucking</td>
																						<td>Young otter lying on the stomach of female nursing. Female will be on her back either on land or floating in water. </td></tr>

																						<tr><td>Interaction with humans </td>
																							<td>Any interaction with humans in the enclosure this could be for training purposes as in the picture or feeding or just following </td></tr>

																							<tr><td>Alert</td>
																								<td>Animal stands still either on hind legs as or on all four limbs. Head is up and looking around the environment. This must occur for longer than 5 seconds continuously. </td></tr>

																								<tr><td>Interact with enrichment</td>
																									<td>Individuals touching of sniffing any objects other than food items added to the enclosure. This can be both on land and in the water and can be a single animal or group interaction. </td></tr>

																							<span><p><b>Interesting findings from research:</b><br><br>— From observation of the precedent works of sea otter enrichment, it can easily find out that the sea otters were extremely active and interested in novel things. These toys are in fruitful colors and some of them have food contained or attractive scent diffused.  They tended to touch, grasp, and hold the toys with their held in the forelimbs. If the toys are in motion, they tended to chase after them. </p></span>

																								— An interesting fact is that sea otter pups float as soon as they are born, but need to learn swimming, which is not an inherent behavior of the sea otter. In the wild, mom would tow the pup between feeding and resting area [7]. From the video above(0:28 - 0:31), it can be discovered that the sea otter pup was trying to turn over clumsily but failed. I conjecture that the action of turning over and also rolling in the water are not inherent, which should be taught and are ubiquitous in a lot of behaviors listed in the ethogram above. </p></span>

																									<span><p><b>Design background, motivation, and goal:</b><br>
																										Inspired by the Saving Sea Otter 696, a case of the sea otter surrogate program, which is a part of the sea otter rescuing programme of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, I am interested in designing enrichment device for raising and training sea otter in such kind of program. I believe that the sea otter 696 would not be the only stranded sea otter pup that needs help from humans to survive and return to nature eventually. Devices and processes should be designed to make humanitarian assistance more effortless.<br><br>

																										In this case, I would focus on designing surrogate devices that help the sea otter orphans learn and improve their skills of swimming and doing basic rolling actions in the water. Hopefully, basic social skills can be triggered. The surrogate devices substitute the roles that should originally be played by the moms and peers in the natural states.
