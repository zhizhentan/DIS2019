										<span><p>My background was industrial design. I am more familiar with another concept, empathy, which is similar to the anthropomorphism. In short, empathy is about thinking of something from the perspective of others. Empathy is so common to me because as a designer, I have to design for others but rather than myself. So the question is how to get to know what the target users’ demand. Empathy, to me, is an introspective quality/tool that I experience what the target user would experience, imagine that I was the target user himself/herself, and then put forward solutions or test prototypes. The more detailed the designers contextualize the target users and the deeper they immersive themselves into the context, the more profound insight, and solutions can be acquired. It is common for designers to live days without vision just in order to understand how visually impaired people live and do design for them. <br><br>

The reading reminded me of a conversation between me and my neighbor, who was a dog keeper. It was a very cold day and he was going to take his dog out for a walk. When I saw his dog was put on a heavy “sweater”, I was so curious that I asked him how did he know his dog feeling cold and how it would behave when you thought it felt cold? His response was that when the dog felt cold, it would be extremely reluctant to walk, keeping sitting on its rear on the ground, and be attached to the auto-doors of the stores from where the warm air would come out. I was quite surprised at his answer since based on my introspective experience as a human, it would link the perception of “cold” with the actions like “tremble” and “get moving”. Using the concept anthropocentric anthropomorphism, introduced in the reading, people would explain the dog’s behavior would be easily understood as “it feels tired so it is not willing to walk”.<br><br>

Anthropomorphism is such a double-edged sword. On the one hand, if it is applied improperly, it would result in the overestimation of humans and animals and the misattribution of human qualities, thoughts, and intentions to non-humans. On the other hand, if it is applied properly, it can help people learn animals behavior by providing more testable ideas. <br><br>

According to the article, there is four hierarchy of anthropomorphism for understanding the human-animal differentiation: No differentiation, Anthropocentric anthropomorphism, Animalcentric anthropomorphism, and Heuristic anthropomorphism. From my perspective, the most important functional difference between hierarchy 3, animalcentric anthropomorphism and hierarchy 4, heuristic anthropomorphism is that the former one results in respecting the differentiation between humans and animals and the latter one results in understanding animals based on the premise of being aware of the existence of human-animal differentiation. Anthropomorphism is crucial in learning animal because it serves as the input of speculation and as Darwin’s words, without speculation, there is no good and original observation. Moreover, as what Shepard once said, anthropomorphism binds our continuity with the rest of the natural world, which can be the motivation of our observations.<br><br>

The workflow of using heuristic anthropomorphism to learn animals’ behavior should be like: <br>
Admit the Inevitable difference between humans and animals —— Observe similar behaviors among different species —— give a hypothetical connotation derived of the meaning of the similar human behavior —— test to confirm the hypothesis.  The biggest challenge comes from the “workspace” of permissible hypotheses, that is what a good hypothesis should be like.<br><br>

Personally, I think one of the key of the observation and the corresponding hypothesis should not focus on the mere behaviors but instead the “contextualized behaviors” that are consisted of both behaviors and the external stimuli perceived by the animals. As is mentioned in the reading, the label “reconciliation” should be understood as the combination of actions and intentions. To this extent, if we ignore the contexts while observing, there is no way to juxtapose the potential intention.<br><br>

The paper is about how can we understand animals behaviors from a more objective human perspective. Something interesting comes to me that how can we understand the understanding that animals have towards us humans from the more objective human perspective? To be further, the question is how can we understand ourselves as individuals more objectively from an extrospective perspective by using the combination of anthropodenial and heuristic anthropomorphism?<br><br>
